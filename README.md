## Description
This project was created as an assignment for creating a site for tracking their budgets offline and online. Users are able to enter deposits offline, enter expenses offline, and when they are brought online then those offline entries should be added to the tracker.

## Installation Instructions
Open the Command Prompt and change your directory to the top level of this application. Once at that directory, verify that you have the package.json file. If you do not, run 'npm init -y.' Once this is completed you will need to run 'npm i'. You will need to run 'npm run seed' at the top level of the project terminal to seed data into your database.
Once this is done you should be good to go.

## Requirements
- As a user, I should be able to enter deposits offline.
- As a user, I should be able to enter expenses offline.
- When brought online, my offline entries should be added to the tracker.


## Usage Information
Firstly verify that all installation instructions are completed. Open the terminal at the top level of the project and run 'npm start' to start the server. The user is able to add deposits while offline, add expenses while offline, and when the user goes online on the site then those entries are added to the tracker.
